# All my python practice

To showcase my coding practice, and expansion of my knowlage.
I enrolled in a 100 day pyhon course on Udemy by Angelina Yu; and do python challanges from practicepython.org

I want to have a collection of all the python projects I do outside of school - which will be showcased here, and on my website! 

12 / 100 - daily python challange
